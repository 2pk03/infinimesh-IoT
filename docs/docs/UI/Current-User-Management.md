# Current User Account Management

Yes, it't not even a Page yet. Just a couple button on Sider.

So by hovering your pointer on Sider, you will see menu with all available pages, and your username in the end.

It's expandable by clicking:

![Tabs](Images/current-user/sider.jpg.jpg?raw=true)
![Tabs](Images/current-user/sider-expanded.jpg?raw=true)

After expanding for now you can:

1. [**Reset Password**](https://github.com/slntopp/infinimesh-frontend-doc/wiki/Miscellaneous#reset-password)
2. Log out - which will bring you back to login page.
